# shadow-cljs (ALPHA)

This library provides a basic configuration layer for ClojureScript and attempts to provide some good defaults so you can limit the amount of config repetition for your builds. 

**Please see the [wiki](https://github.com/thheller/shadow-devtools/wiki/Using-shadow-devtools) for further instructions.**

You can find the latest version here:

**Clojure 1.9-alpha16 is required, which makes this just as alpha!**
