## Requirements

- [node.js](https://nodejs.org) (v6.0.0+, most recent version preferred)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) (comes bundled with `node.js`) or [yarn](https://www.yarnpkg.com)
- [Java SDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/) (Version 8+, Hotspot)

## Quick Start

Creating your project can be done quickly using the `npx create-cljs-project` utility. `npx` is part of `npm` and lets us run utility scripts quickly without worrying about installing them first. The installer will create a basic project scaffold and install the latest version of `shadow-cljs` in the project.

```bash
$ npx create-cljs-project acme-app
npx: installed 1 in 5.887s
shadow-cljs - creating project: .../acme-app
Creating: .../acme-app/package.json
Creating: .../acme-app/shadow-cljs.edn
Creating: .../acme-app/.gitignore
Creating: .../acme-app/src/main
Creating: .../acme-app/src/test
----
Installing shadow-cljs in project.

npm notice created a lockfile as package-lock.json. You should commit this file.
+ shadow-cljs@<version>
added 88 packages from 103 contributors and audited 636 packages in 6.287s
found 0 vulnerabilities

----
Done.
----
```

The resulting project has the following structure

```bash
.
├── node_modules (omitted ...)
├── package.json
├── package-lock.json
├── shadow-cljs.edn
└── src
    ├── main
    └── test
```

`shadow-cljs.edn` will be used to configure your CLJS builds and CLJS dependencies. `package.json` is used by `npm` to manage JS dependencies.

Everything is ready to go if you just want to start playing with a REPL

```bash
$ npx shadow-cljs node-repl
# or
$ npx shadow-cljs browser-repl
```

When building actual projects we need to configure the build first and create at least one source file.

The default source paths are configured to use `src/main` as the primary source directory. It is recommended to follow the [Java Naming Conventions](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/package/namingpkgs.html) to organize your CLJS namespaces. It is recommended to start all namespaces with a unique enough prefix (eg. company name, project name) to avoid conflicts with generic names such as `app.core`. Suppose you were building a Web Frontend for [Acme Inc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acme_Corporation) using `acme.frontend.app` might be a good starting point as it can easily grow to include `acme.backend.*` later on.

Using the above example the expected filename for `acme.frontend.app` is `src/main/acme/frontend/app.cljs`.

Lets start with a simple example for a browser-based build.

```clojure
(ns acme.frontend.app)

(defn init []
  (println "Hello World"))
```

Inside the `shadow-cljs.edn` `:builds` section add

```clojure
{...
 :builds
 {:frontend
  {:target :browser
   :modules {:main {:init-fn acme.frontend.app/init}}
   }}}
```

This config tells the compiler to call `(acme.frontend.app/init)` when the generated JS code is loaded. Since no `:output-dir` is configured the default `public/js` is used. You can start the development process by running:

```bash
$ npx shadow-cljs watch frontend
...
a few moments later ...
...
[:frontend] Build completed. (134 files, 35 compiled, 0 warnings, 5.80s)
```

The compilation will create the `public/js/main.js` we configured above (`:main` becomes `main.js` in the `:output-dir`). Since we want to load this in the browser we need to create a HTML file in `public/index.html`.

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>acme frontend</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script src="/js/main.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

We also need a simple HTTP server to serve our HTML since modern Browsers all place a few restrictions on files loaded directly from disk which will lead to issues later. `shadow-cljs` provides such a server but you can use anything you like at this point. It only matters that the files from the `public` directory are served properly. To start the built-in web server just adjust the build config from above.

```clojure
{...
 :dev-http {8080 "public"}
 :builds
 {:frontend
  {:target :browser
   :modules {:main {:init-fn acme.frontend.app/init}}
   }}}
```

Once the config is saved the server will automatically start and serve the content at http://localhost:8080. There is no need to restart `shadow-cljs`. When opening the above URL the Browser Console should show "Hello World".
